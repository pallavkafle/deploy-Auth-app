This is a simple full-stack authentication app built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It supports user registration, login, protected routes, password validation, and JWT-based session management. The frontend is styled with basic CSS and includes toast notifications for user feedback. Designed as a boilerplate for future MERN projects with secure auth flow.
